  <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
  <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_black" title = "JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
    often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language
    that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
    It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic,
    weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.<br><br>

    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core
    technologies of the World Wide Web.
    JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an
    essential part of web applications.
    The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web
    browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
